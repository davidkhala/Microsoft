> [Scanning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-scans-and-ingestion?source=recommendations#scanning) captures metadata from [data sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/microsoft-purview-connector-overview) and brings it to Microsoft Purview. 

Navigation: `Data Map` -> `Data Sources` -> `Register` 

Scan cannot sync with data source delete action, you have to delete them in Purview mannually.
